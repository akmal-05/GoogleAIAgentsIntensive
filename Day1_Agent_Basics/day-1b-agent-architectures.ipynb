Complex challenges can be broken down into smaller, specialized tasks, with individual agents tackling their unique parts. This distributed intelligence leverages the collective knowledge of multiple agents, tackling problems too large for a single entity. Crucially, this approach enhances resilience; if one agent falters, others can often compensate, making your systems more robust.\n\nFor developers, this translates to boosted efficiency and agility. Picture agents autonomously writing boilerplate code, suggesting optimizations, or even refactoring existing code. Imagine intelligent agents exploring code paths, identifying potential bugs, and proposing fixes, drastically reducing manual testing efforts.

The rhythmic sweep of its beam was the only sound in the tower, save for the lonely cry of gulls. Tonight, however, an anomaly disturbed the predictable peace. Tucked beneath a loose floorboard, a rolled parchment shimmered with an ethereal, cerulean light. Unfurling it carefully, Elias found not a chart of known waters, but a swirling, phosphorescent depiction of constellations he’d never seen, arranged around a single, pulsating star. A faint humming vibrated from the paper, a melody both ancient and impossibly new. The map seemed to breathe, its glowing lines shifting, beckoning him towards a destination beyond the horizon, a place whispered only in the wildest sea tales.\nCriticAgent > This is a strong start with a lot of evocative imagery! Here are a few suggestions to further enhance it:\n\n1.  **Develop Elias's Reaction and Motivation:** While the discovery is intriguing, Elias's internal reaction feels a bit understated. Does he feel fear, excitement, disbelief, or a profound sense of destiny? Showing his emotional response and hinting at what drives him (curiosity, a desire for adventure, a longing for something more than his solitary life) would make him a more compelling character. For example, you could add a sentence about his heart thumping, or a memory of a childhood dream.\n\n2.  **Hint at the \"Wildest Sea Tales\":** The story mentions the map leading to a place \"whispered only in the wildest sea tales.\" Briefly alluding to one of these tales, perhaps a legend Elias has heard but dismissed as folklore, could add depth and foreshadowing. This would give the reader a stronger sense of what Elias is potentially stepping into and why this map is so extraordinary.\n\n3.  **Enhance the Sensory Details of the Map:** The description of the map is good, but consider adding one more sensory element beyond sight and sound. Does the parchment feel strange to the touch? Does it have a scent? For example, you could mention the parchment feeling unnaturally smooth or cool, or carrying a faint, ozone-like smell. This would make the magical object even more tangible and immersive.\nRefinerAgent > Elias, his beard flecked with sea salt and years, polished the great lamp. The rhythmic sweep of its beam was the only sound in the tower, save for the lonely cry of gulls. Tonight, however, an anomaly disturbed the predictable peace.

A faint humming vibrated from the paper, a melody both ancient and impossibly new. The map seemed to breathe, its glowing lines shifting, beckoning him towards a destination beyond the horizon, a place whispered only in the wildest sea tales – tales of the Sunken City of Aeridor, which Elias had always dismissed as fanciful yarns spun by drunken sailors.\n\nHis heart, usually a steady, reliable drum against his ribs, began to thump with an unfamiliar, excited rhythm. Disbelief warred with a sudden, overwhelming sense of destiny. He remembered, as a boy gazing at the very same sea, dreaming of islands that existed beyond maps, of adventures that called to the restless soul. This parchment, cool and impossibly smooth to the touch, seemed to pulse with that forgotten yearning. It carried a faint, ozone-like scent, the smell of a storm on the horizon, or perhaps, something far more profound. The glowing lines on the map shifted, a silent invitation to a journey that promised the impossible, a world away from the solitary, predictable life of a lighthouse keeper.\nCriticAgent > APPROVED\n","output_type":"stream"},{"name":"stderr","text":"WARNING:google_genai.types:Warning: there are non-text parts in the response: ['function_call'], returning concatenated text result from text parts.

Most importantly, you learned how to be the **director** of that team.\n\nYou used `SequentialAgent`, `ParallelAgent`, and `LoopAgent` to create deterministic workflows, and you even used an LLM as a 'manager' to make dynamic decisions. You also mastered the \"plumbing\" by using `output_key` to pass state between agents and make them collaborative.\n\n**ℹ️ Note: No submission required!**\n\nThis notebook is for your hands-on practice and learning only.
