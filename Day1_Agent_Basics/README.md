# Day 1: Agent Basics

## Learning Objectives
Today we focus on understanding **AI agents** and how they work:
- What AI agents are and how they differ from regular LLMs
- Core components of an agent: Goal, Perception, Reasoning, Action, Memory, Environment
- Common agent architectures and patterns
- Simple hands-on experiment using a reasoning loop

## Topics Covered
- Introduction to AI Agents
- Agent vs. LLM: Key Differences
- Core Agent Architecture: ReAct, Tool-Using, Multi-Agent, Loop-Based
- Agent Workflows and Decision Loops
- Mini Experiment: Building a Simple Reasoning Agent

## Daily Goals
- Understand the fundamental concepts of AI agents
- Explore different agent architectures
- Experiment with a small ReAct-style reasoning loop
- Document key learnings and reflections in `concepts.md`

## Resources
- `notebook_template.ipynb` for hands-on experiments
- `concepts.md` to record notes and insights
- Reference materials in `../Resources/`

## Next Steps

After completing Day 1, proceed to [Day 2: Tools and Interoperability](../Day2_Tools_and_Interoperability/)
