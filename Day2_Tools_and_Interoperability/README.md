# Day 2: Tools and Interoperability

## Learning Objectives

Today we'll learn how to extend agent capabilities through tools and APIs:
- Integrating tools with agents
- API interactions and webhooks
- Multi-tool orchestration
- Tool selection and execution strategies
- Building custom tools

## Topics Covered

- Tool Integration Patterns
- API Integration with Agents
- Multi-Tool Orchestration
- Tool Selection Mechanisms
- Custom Tool Development
- Error Handling in Tool Execution

## Daily Goals

- [ ] Integrate at least 2-3 different tools with an agent
- [ ] Build a custom tool for a specific use case
- [ ] Understand tool selection and execution flow
- [ ] Document tool integration patterns in `concepts.md`

## Resources

- Use `notebook_template.ipynb` for hands-on experiments
- Record concepts and insights in `concepts.md`
- Reference materials in `../Resources/`

## Next Steps

After completing Day 2, proceed to [Day 3: Context and Memory](../Day3_Context_and_Memory/)
