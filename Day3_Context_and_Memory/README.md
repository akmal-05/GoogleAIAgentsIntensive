# Day 3: Context and Memory

## Learning Objectives
Today’s focus is on how agents handle information over time—maintaining context, managing memory, and optimizing performance.

By the end of this session, you should understand:
- Context window management
- Short-term and long-term memory systems
- State management in agents
- Conversation history and context retention
- Memory optimization strategies

---

## Topics Covered
1. **Context Window Management** – Understanding how LLMs process limited context and techniques to optimize it.  
2. **Memory Systems (Short-term vs. Long-term)** – Implementing temporary and persistent storage for agent knowledge.  
3. **State Management Patterns** – Designing internal structures for agents to maintain reasoning state.  
4. **Conversation History Handling** – Capturing, storing, and retrieving multi-turn dialogue efficiently.  
5. **Context Compression Techniques** – Summarization and pruning to reduce token cost.  
6. **Memory Retrieval Strategies** – Fetching relevant memories based on recency, relevance, and importance.

## Daily Goals
- Implement a basic **memory system** for an agent.  
- Understand **context window limitations** and ways to extend effective reasoning.  
- Build **state management** for multi-turn interactions.  
- Document insights and architectures in **concepts.md**.
