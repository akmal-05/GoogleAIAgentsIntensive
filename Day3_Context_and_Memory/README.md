# Day 3: Context and Memory

## Learning Objectives

Today we'll explore how agents manage context and maintain memory:
- Context window management
- Short-term and long-term memory systems
- State management in agents
- Conversation history and context retention
- Memory optimization strategies

## Topics Covered

- Context Window Management
- Memory Systems (Short-term vs. Long-term)
- State Management Patterns
- Conversation History Handling
- Context Compression Techniques
- Memory Retrieval Strategies

## Daily Goals

- [ ] Implement a memory system for an agent
- [ ] Understand context window limitations and solutions
- [ ] Build state management for multi-turn conversations
- [ ] Document memory patterns in `concepts.md`

## Resources

- Use `notebook_template.ipynb` for hands-on experiments
- Record concepts and insights in `concepts.md`
- Reference materials in `../Resources/`

## Next Steps

After completing Day 3, proceed to [Day 4: Evaluation and Quality](../Day4_Evaluation_and_Quality/)
