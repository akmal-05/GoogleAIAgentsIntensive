# Day 4: Evaluation and Quality

## Learning Objectives

Today we'll learn how to evaluate and ensure quality in AI agents:
- Agent evaluation frameworks
- Quality metrics and benchmarks
- Testing strategies for agents
- Debugging agent behavior
- Performance optimization

## Topics Covered

- Evaluation Frameworks
- Quality Metrics (Accuracy, Latency, Cost)
- Testing Strategies
- Debugging Techniques
- Performance Monitoring
- A/B Testing for Agents

## Daily Goals

- [ ] Set up an evaluation framework for an agent
- [ ] Implement quality metrics and monitoring
- [ ] Create test cases for agent behavior
- [ ] Document evaluation strategies in `concepts.md`

## Resources

- Use `notebook_template.ipynb` for hands-on experiments
- Record concepts and insights in `concepts.md`
- Reference materials in `../Resources/`

## Next Steps

After completing Day 4, proceed to [Day 5: Capstone Project](../Day5_Capstone_Project/)
