# 🚀 Day 5 README  
## Prototype to Production

Day 5 focuses on turning an agent prototype into a reliable, secure, and scalable production system. This stage goes beyond building agents and emphasizes trust, evaluation, and continuous improvement.

---

## 🔍 Core Concepts  
- Production requires more than a working demo, it needs reliability, guardrails, monitoring, and cost control.  
- Evaluation becomes a deployment gate, checking outputs, reasoning, tools, and safety.  
- CI CD automates testing, evaluation, staging, and controlled rollout.  
- Observability through logs, traces, and metrics reveals agent behavior and blind spots.  
- Security must be built in from the start, covering injection, tool misuse, and data safety.  
- Controlled rollout strategies like canary, blue green, and feature flags reduce deployment risk.  
- Agents evolve continuously through an improvement loop of observe, evaluate, update, and redeploy.

## 🧱 Key Pillars  
- **Evaluation** quality gates before deployment  
- **Automation** via CI CD pipelines  
- **Observability** for insight and debugging  
- **Security** as a core architectural layer  
- **Rollout Safety** through staged releases  
- **Continuous Evolution** and monitoring  
- **Multi Agent Readiness** using A2A protocols and MCP

## ✅ Summary  
Day 5 brings all previous concepts together by introducing AgentOps, the framework for operating agents in real world environments. Moving from prototype to production requires discipline, automation, and ongoing evaluation to ensure agents remain safe, effective, and trustworthy.
